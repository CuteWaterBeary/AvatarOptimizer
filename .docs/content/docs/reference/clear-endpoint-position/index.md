# Clear Endpoint Position

This component will replace EndpointPosition to 0 with adding `_EndPhysBone` GameObject.

This component doesn't have any configuration for now but there's one button on the view.
Clicking `Apply and Remove component` will applies this operation and removes this component.
This may be useful for developing avatars.
